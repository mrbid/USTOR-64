# USTOR-64 - A Linux/C solution for Tracking UID's and Unique Capping.

### Initially intended for use with Advertising Servers or Real-Time Bidding (OpenRTB) Demand-Side Platforms (DSP).

**Performance**; READ O(1) - WRITE O(1) prime number hash map using CRC64.

**USTOR-64** uses the UDP protocol for maximum throughput, a hash map using a prime number, a simple bucketing system that is adequate enough for the purpose of dealing with hash collisions
and cache efficient pre-allocated memory.

**Threading**; POSIX Threads are used to thread the Read operations, one thread per CPU core is created.

**Read** operations are on UDP port 7811.

**Write** operations are single-threaded on port 7810.

SHA1 is used in the PHP code to hash the userid before it is sent to the USTOR daemon, once it arrives it is hashed a second time into a CRC64 index for the HashMap.

By default 433,033,301 *(433 Million)* impressions can be recorded not including collisions. Collisions are range blocked using two short integers to make the whole struct a total size of 8 bytes.

The current configuration uses ~3.2 GB of memory.


### PHP Functions for Write and Check operations

```
function add_ustor($userid, $expire_seconds)
{
    if($expire_seconds == 0){$expire_seconds = 86400;}
    if($userid == ''){$userid = "u";}
    $fp = stream_socket_client("udp://127.0.0.1:7810", $errno, $errstr, 1);
    if($fp)
    {
        fwrite($fp, "$" . sha1($userid) . "|" . $expire_seconds);
        fclose($fp);
    }
}
```

```
function check_ustor($userid)
{
    if($userid == ''){$userid = "u";}
    $fp = stream_socket_client("udp://127.0.0.1:7811", $errno, $errstr, 1);
    if($fp)
    {
        $r = fwrite($fp, sha1($userid));
        if($r == FALSE)
        {
            fclose($fp);
            return TRUE;
        }
        //stream_set_timeout($fp, 1);
        $r = fread($fp, 1);
        if($r != FALSE && $r[0] == 'n')
        {
            fclose($fp);
            return FALSE; //FALSE = Not Stored, You can bid.
        }
        fclose($fp);
        return TRUE;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```
